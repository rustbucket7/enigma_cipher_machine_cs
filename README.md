# Enigma Cipher Machine
This project is a C# implementation of the Enigma 1/M3 cipher machine used by the German Army and Air Force to encrypt/decrypt their communication to various parts of Europe before and during World War 2.

## Description
This implementation of Enigma makes use of rotors 1 to 5 and reflectors A, B, and C.

The application will encrypt a user's message by performing multiple substitution ciphers through the Enigma machine's various components: a plugboard, three moving rotors, and a reflector. At each component, an input letter will be changed to some other letter which the next component will then use as its input. A letter typed by the user will never be returned as itself after going through the entire encrypting/decrypting process.

The encrypt/decrypt process looks like this:
- User types a message ->
- message will be changed once at the plugboard ->
- changed message will be changed once at each of the three rotors (three changes)->
- another change will be made at the reflector ->
- the message will be changed once more through the three rotors (three changes) ->
- one last change at the plugboard again ->
- output
- DONE

Altogether, each letter in the input message can be changed up to 9 times.

## How to Use via Command line/Terminal
To encrypt a message:
- Setup Enigma machine
- Run the program
- Type in your message
- Press Enter
- Copy the output

To decrypt a message:
- Setup Enigma machine to the same settings as you did for encryption
- Run the program
- Type in your encrypted message
- Press Enter
- Copy the output

Setting up the Enigma machine:
1. Open the main.cs file in an IDE or text editor
2. Look for the section below the line saying `static public void Main()`
3. Change the following settings to suit your encryption/decryption needs:
- rotor_choices (list<int>, length 3): the order of your rotors from left to right. Requires three unique rotors to be used. Ex. {2, 1, 3}.
- plugboard_pairings (list<string>, any length): the pairs of letters that will get swapped at the plugboard. Letters can only be used once. Ex. {"GZ", "YQ", "OP", "LA"}.
- initial_rotor_settings (list<char>, length 3): sets the starting position of each rotor. Ex. {'R', 'A', 'O'}.
- ring_settings (list<char>, length 3): sets the desired ciphering for each rotor. Ex. {'B', 'M', 'X'}.
- reflector (char, length 1): choose which reflector to use. Ex. 'A'.
4.  Build and run the program using an IDE like Visual Studio 2022 to begin encrypting/decrypting a message

## How to Use in Another Python Program
1. Put main.cs, enigma.cs, plugboard.cs, reflector.cs, rotor.cs, and helpers.cs into some directory usable by your C# program or project
2. Import the "EnigmaRun" namespace into your program. Ex. "using EnigmaRun;"
3. Perform encrypt/decrypt with the following call:
- EnigmaRun.enigma_run(arg1, arg2, ..., arg6)
- - The following 6 arguments are required in the following order:
- - - rotor_choices (list<int>, length 3): the order of your rotors from left to right. Requires three unique rotors to be used. Ex. {2, 1, 3}.
- - - plugboard_pairings (list<string>, any length): the pairs of letters that will get swapped at the plugboard. Letters can only be used once. Ex. {"GZ", "YQ", "OP", "LA"}.
- - - initial_rotor_settings (list<char>, length 3): sets the starting position of each rotor. Ex. {'R', 'A', 'O'}.
- - - ring_settings (list<char>, length 3): sets the desired ciphering for each rotor. Ex. {'B', 'M', 'X'}.
- - - reflector (char, length 1): choose which reflector to use. Ex. 'A'.
- - - input_str (string, length > 0): a string of LETTERS you want to encrypt/decrypt using the settings above. Letters can be upper or lowercase (return value will only be uppercase letters). Ex. "abcdef ghijklmn"
4. You can capture the output by setting enigma_run(...) within a variable or printing it out. Ex. "var1 = EnigmaRun.enigma_run(...)" or "Console.WriteLine((enigma_run(...))"
